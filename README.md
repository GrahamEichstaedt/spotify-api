# Spotify API

The spotify api gives us access to an immense amount of data to interact with all of our favorite songs, albums, artists, and playlists.
This project is designed to give you tools to discover new music based off some of your existing taste. 

There are three primary ways to generate playlists in this project:
- From an existing playlist
- From a song you like
- From a genre you like

* Note - this project is in development mode and as such, there is a maximum of 25 registered users. Any users beyond
that may not be able to have their playlists appear without having existing users booted from the registry. *
